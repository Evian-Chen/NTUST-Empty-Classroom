# Toastmasters Campus Committee â€” Frontend (Vue 3 + Vite, JavaScript)

A starter for the Campus Committee website to connect student clubs with community/corporate clubs.

## Tech
- Vue 3 + Vite (JavaScript)
- Vue Router, Pinia
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios (with auth interceptor)

## Getting Started
```bash
npm i

## Structure
- `src/pages/*` route pages
- `src/stores/*` Pinia stores
- `src/components/*` shared components
- `src/utils/http.js` Axios instance

## Next Steps
